## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
- Internet connection
- Java 17
- MySQL Database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sopra-fs24-group-05/sopra-fs24-group-05-server.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd rank-everything
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up MySQL database:

    - Install MySQL from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)

    - Create a database and user for the project:

      ```sql
      CREATE DATABASE rank_everything;
      CREATE USER 'rank_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
      GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON rank_everything.* TO 'rank_user'@'localhost';
      FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
      ```

5. Configure the database connection:

    - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory and add the following:

      ```env
      DB_HOST=localhost
      DB_USER=rank_user
      DB_PASSWORD=password
      DB_NAME=rank_everything
      ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Building with Gradle

You can use the local Gradle Wrapper to build the application.

- macOS: `./gradlew`
- Linux: `./gradlew`
- Windows: `./gradlew.bat`

### Build

```
./gradlew build
```

### Run

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

You can verify that the server is running by visiting `localhost:8080` in your browser.

### Test

```
./gradlew test
```

### Development Mode

You can start the backend in development mode, this will automatically trigger a new build and reload the application once the content of a file has been changed.

Start two terminal windows and run

```
./gradlew build --continuous
```

and in the other one:

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

If you want to avoid running all tests with every change, use the following command instead:

```
./gradlew build --continuous -xtest
```
